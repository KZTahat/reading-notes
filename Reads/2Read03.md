# HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model
<!-- Chapter 3: “Lists” (pp.62-73) -->
## Lists: <br />
There are three diferent types of lists in **html** :
- Orderd list:<br />
    the orderd list is created with the ```<ol>``` element where each item in the list is placed between an opening ```<li>``` tag and a closing ```</li>``` tag where the li stands for list item.
- Unorderd list:<br />
    the unorderd list is created with the ```<ul>``` element and each item in the list is placed between an opening ```<li>``` tag and a closing ```</li>``` tag.
- Definition Lists:<br />
    The definition list is created with the ```<dl>``` element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions. Inside the ```<dl>``` we will usually see pairs of ```<dt>``` element where this is used to contain the term being defined (the definition term) and ```<dd>``` element where this is used to contain the definition. Sometimes you might see a list where there are two terms used for the same definition or two different definitions for the same term.
- Nested Lists:<br />
    You can put a second list inside an ```<li>``` element to create a sublist or nested list. Browsers display nested lists indented further than the parent list. In nested unordered lists, the browser will usually change the style of the bullet point too.

<!-- Chapter 13: “Boxes” (pp.300-329) -->
## Boxes: <br />
We can set several prperties that affect the appearance of **Boxes**, so we can :<br />
1.  Control the dimensions of your boxes.<br />
    By default a box is sized just big enough to hold its contents. To set your own dimensions for a box you can use the height and width properties, the most popular ways to specify the size of a box are to use pixels, percentages, or ems. When we use the percentage the size of the box is the percent size of it's containing box, when you use ems, the size of the box is based on the size of text within it where this is being used more often by designers because of it's flexibility across devices which have different-sized screens.<br />
    Some page designs expand and shrink to fit the size of the user's screen. In such designs, the **min-width** property specifies the smallest size a box can be displayed at when the browser window is narrow, and the **max-width** property indicates the maximum width a box can stretch to when the browser window is wide.<br />
    In the same way that you might want to limit the width of a box on a page, you may also want to limit the height of it. This is achieved using the min-heightand max-height properties. If the box is not big enough to hold the content, and the content expands outside the box it can look very messy. To control what happens when there is not enough space for the content of a box, you can use the **overflow property**, which is discussed on the next page.<br />
    The overflow property tells the browser what to do if the content contained within a box is larger than the box itself. It can have one of two values:
    - *Hidden*: This property simply hides any extra content that does not fit in the box.
    - *scroll*: This property adds a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll to see the missing content.
2. Set Borders, margins and padding for boxes.<br />
    Every box has a border (even if it is not visible or is specified to be 0 pixels wide). The border separates the edge of one box from another. Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes. Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents.<br />
3. Show and hide boxes.<br />
    The visibility property allows you to hide boxes from users but It leaves a space where the element would have been, This property can take two values: **hidden** This hides the element, **visible** and this shows the element.


<!-- Review from Reading 02 - Chapter 2: “Basic JavaScript Instructions” (pp.70-73) -->
## Basic JavaScript Instructios:<br />
- Arrays:<br />
    An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values. You should consider using an array whenever you are working with a list or a set of values that are related to each other. If you don't know how many items a list will contain, rather than creating enough variables for a long list (when you might only use a small percentage of them), using an array is considered a better solution.<br />
    - Creating an Array:<br />
        ```
        let colors; 
        colors ['white', 'black', ' custom']; 
        ```
        The values are assigned to the array inside a pair of square brackets, and each value is separated by a comma. The values in the array do not need to be the same data type, so you can store a string, a number and a Boolean all in the same array. This technique for creating an array is known as an array literal. It is usually the preferred method for creating an array. You can also write each value on a separate line: 
        ```
        colors= ['white', 
                'black', 
                'custom']; 
        ```
        A different technique to creat an array called an **array constructor**. This uses the **new** keyword followed by *Array();* The values are then specified in parentheses (not square brackets), and each value is separated by a comma. You can also use a method called **item()** to retrieve data from the array. (The index number of the item is specified in the parentheses).
