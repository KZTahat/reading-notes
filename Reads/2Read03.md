# HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model
## Lists: <br />
There are three diferent types of lists in **html** :
- Orderd list:<br />
    the orderd list is created with the ```<ol>``` element where each item in the list is placed between an opening ```<li>``` tag and a closing ```</li>``` tag where the li stands for list item.
- Unorderd list:<br />
    the unorderd list is created with the ```<ul>``` element and each item in the list is placed between an opening ```<li>``` tag and a closing ```</li>``` tag.
- Definition Lists:<br />
    The definition list is created with the ```<dl>``` element and usually consists of a series of terms and their definitions. Inside the ```<dl>``` we will usually see pairs of ```<dt>``` element where this is used to contain the term being defined (the definition term) and ```<dd>``` element where this is used to contain the definition. Sometimes you might see a list where there are two terms used for the same definition or two different definitions for the same term.
- Nested Lists:<br />
    You can put a second list inside an ```<li>``` element to create a sublist or nested list. Browsers display nested lists indented further than the parent list. In nested unordered lists, the browser will usually change the style of the bullet point too.
