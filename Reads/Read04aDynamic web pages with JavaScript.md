# Dynamic web pages with JavaScript
## HOW HTML, CSS, & JAVASCRIPT FIT TOGETHER

Web developing usually done with three languages which are used to creat web pages **(HTML, CSS, JavaScript)**, so befor jumbing into the JavaScript language we need to understand the way these three languages are fit together, combining these elements is the html job since we are aiming to keep the three languages in seperate files where possible then linked to the html file. Each language forms a separate layer with a different purpose. Each layer, from *(HTML to CSS to JavaScript)* builds on the previous one.

- The content layer **<html>**  This is where the content of the page lives. The HTML gives the page structure and adds semantics. Starting with the HTML layer allows you to focus on the most important thing about your site: its content. Being plain HTML, this layer should work on all kinds of devices, be accessible to all users, and load quite quickly on slow connections.
- The presentation layer **{CSS}** the CSS enhances the HTML page with rules that state how the HTML content is presented (backgrounds, borders, box dimensions, colors, fonts, etc.). Adding the CSS rules in a separate file keeps rules regarding how the page looks away from the content itself. You can use the same style sheet with all of your site, making your sites faster to load and easier to maintain. Or you can use different style sheets with the same content to create different views of the same data.
- Behaveor layer **JavaScript ()** This is where we can change how the page behaves, adding interactivity. We will aim to keep as much of our JavaScript as possible in separate files. The JavaScript is added last and enhances the usability of the page or the experience of interacting with the site.Keeping it separate means that the page still works if the user cannot load or run the JavaScript. You can also reuse the code on several pages(making the site faster to load and easier to maintain. *JavaScript* is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not need any new tools to write a script.
