# Design web pages with CSS
## color
The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:
  - **RGB values** These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. *For example: rgb(100,100,90)*.
  - **HEX codes** These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign. *For example: #ee3e80*.
  - **color names** There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. *For example: DarkCyan*.

CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears in a box, and the background-color property sets the color of the background for that box.You can specify your choice of background color in the same three ways you can specify foreground colors: RGB values, hex codes, and color names. If you do not specify a background color, then the background is transparent.By default, most browser windows have a white background, but browser users can set a background color for their windows, so if you want to be sure that the background is white you can use the background-color property on the <body> element.


- CSS introduces the opacity property which allows you to specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements. The value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5 is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15% opacity). This value is known as an alpha value and is a number between 0.0 and 1.0(so a value of 0.5 is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15% opacity). The rgba value will only affect the element on which it is applied (not child elements). The hsl color property has been introduced in CSS3 as an alternative way to specify colors. The value of the property starts with the letters hsl, followed by individual values inside parentheses for:
  - **HUE**: This is expressed as an angle (between 0 and 360 degrees).
  - **saturation**: This is expressed as a percentage.
  - **lightness**: This is expressed as a percentage with 0% being white, 50% being normal, and 100% being black.The hsla color property allows you to specify color properties     using hue, saturation, and lightness as above, and adds a fourth value which represents transparency (just like   the rgbaproperty). which is:
  - **AlPHA**: This is expressed as a number between 0 and 1.0. For example, 0.5 represents 50% transparency, and 0.75represents 75% transparency.
