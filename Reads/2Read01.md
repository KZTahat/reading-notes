# Introductory HTML and JavaScript
## Structure 
The use of headings and subheadings in any document often reflects a hierarchy of information. For example, a document might start with a large heading, followed by an introduction or the most important information. This might be expanded upon under subheadings lower down on the page. When using a word processor to create a document, we separate out the text to give it structure. Each topic might have a new paragraph, and each section can have a heading to describe what it covers.On the right, you can see a 
simple document in Microsoft Word. The different styles for the document, such as different levels of heading, are shown in the drop down box. If you regularly use Word, you might have also used the formatting toolbar or palette to do this. To describe the structure of a web page, we add code to the words we want to appear on the page. You can see the HTML code for this page below. We start to look at it in more detail on the next page.

```
<html>
<body>
 <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
 <p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of 
 the page. And if the page is a long one it might 
 be split up into several sub-headings.<p>
 <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
 <p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help 
 you follow the structure of what is being written. 
 There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level 
 headings).</p>
 <h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
 <p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
