# Learning Markdown
## Mastring markdown

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown.

let us start with some simple tasks:

1. **Text**:
  It's very easy to make some words **bold** using double stars (**) or double underscores (__) and other words *italic* using single star (*) or a single underscore (_) with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com "Google.com"), we use the '#' to make headers, You can also create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ). You can also use the keyboard shortcut command + k to create a link.
&nbsp;
2. **Lists**:
  Lists can be made easily by numbers (1,2,...) which called an ordered list or you can creat  an unordred list by putting dashes (-) or stars (*) or pluses (+)and if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star.
&nbsp;
3. **Images and links**:
  If you want to embed *images*, this is how you do it: "![Image discreption](Image URL)" or we can do *Links* by [Image discreption](Image URL). We can also use automatic URL linking like this: 
  > http://www.github.com/
&nbsp;
4. ** Blockquotes and Inline code**:
&nbsp;
  We can form a quoteblock like this:
&nbsp;
  ```
  As Kanye West said:

  > We're living the future so
  > the present is our past.
  ```
  ```
  and to do inline code I think you should use an
  `<addr>` element here instead.
  ```
&nbsp;

5. ** Syntax highlighting, Task Lists and tables**

&nbsp;

  we can syntax highlighting doing this:

&nbsp;

    ```
      ```javascript
      function fancyAlert(arg) {
        if(arg) {
          $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
        }
      } ```
    ```
&nbsp;

  we can also do task lists with this:

&nbsp;

    ``` 
    - [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
    - [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
    - [x] this is a complete item
    - [ ] this is an incomplete item
    ```
  and it will be shown like this:

&nbsp;

    - [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
    - [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
    - [x] this is a complete item
    - [ ] this is an incomplete item

  Tables are also can be formed in markdown:

&nbsp;

    ```
    First Header | Second Header
    ------------ | -------------
    Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
    Content in the first column | Content in the second column
    ```
&nbsp;

  and it will look like this:

&nbsp;

  First Header | Second Header
  ------------ | -------------
  Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
  Content in the first column | Content in the second column

&nbsp;
