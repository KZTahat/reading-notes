## How computers work

Evry where we look computers are changed in the world, whether they are on our desktops, our homes, our pockets, or just about any where else. But while most of us use this revolutionary technology daily we don't often ask **How comuters work?** so we need to learn how computers rellay work, starting from what makes computer a computer. Then we will look at how information is represented inside the computer using riny electrical signals going on and off at mind-boggling speeds then how they use circuits to do evrything from simple math to simulating entire virtual worlds.

computers are created to help us with the manual and thinking work we do, mayabe do it for us, like solving equations or tracking the stars in the sky. As the pioneers of computer science exploard how to designe a thinking machine they realized that they have to perform four different tasks.
It would need to :
- **take input** keyboard, mouse, camera, rest heartbeat or fingerprints on a touch screen.
- **store information**. Memory
- **proccess it** using algorrithms which are a series of commands the proccesor mainpulate information coimg from storage then send it back to be storaed in memory again till proccessed information is ready to be output.
- **Then output the results** which depends on what the computeris designed to do, a computer display can show text, photoes, vidoes or interactive games even virthual-reality or maybe signals to control a robot or we could use it as an input to another computer

this might sound simple but these four thasks are commom to all computers, the thing what makes a computer a computer, erlaier computers was made of wood and steal gears where theuy started out as basic calculators where a room size computer would take houres to solve a simple math problem and only used to mainpulate numbers, but now we use them to talke to each other, play games, control robots and do any thing we could possibly imagine doing the same old four steps.
