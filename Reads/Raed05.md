# Operators and Loops
## Comparison operators 
- Is equal to (**==**)
this operator compares to values (numbers, strings or boolean) to see if they are the same.
- Is not equal to (**!=**)
  this operator compares to values (numbers, strings or boolean) to see if they are not the same.
- Strict equal to (**===**)
  this operator compares two values (numbers, strings or boolean) to check poth the datatype and value are the same.
- Strict not equal to (**!==**)
  this operator compares two values (numbers, strings or boolean) to check poth the datatype and value are not the same.
- Greater than (**>**)
  this operator checks if the number on the left is *greater than* the number on the right.
- Less than (**<**)
  this operator checks if the number on the left is *less than* the number on the right.
- Greater than or equal to (**>=**)
  this operator checks if the number on the left is *greater than* or *equal* to the number on the right.
- Less than or equal to (**<=**)
  this operator checks if the number on the left is*8less than* or *equal* to the number on the right.

## Logical operators
Comparison operatores usually return single values of true and false while logical operatores allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.

- **Logical AND** (**&&**)
  this operator tests more than one condition (if both expression evaluate to *true* then the expression returns *true*. If just one of these return *false* then the expression returns *false*).
- **logical OR** (**||**)
  this operator tests at least one condition (if either expression evaluates to *true* then the expression returns *true*. If both return *false* then the expression returns *false*).
- **Logical NOT** (**!**) 
  This operator takes a single boolean value and inverts it. This reverses the state of an expression if it was *false* it will return *true*, if the statment was *true* it returns *false*.

## Loops 
- **FOR loop** 
  used when we want to run code specific number of times, it is the most common loop where the condition is usually a counter which tolds how many times the loop should run.
- **WHILE loop**
  used when we do not know how many times we need to run a code, here the condition can be something other then a counter and the code will continue to loop as long as the condition is *true*.
- **DO WHILE loop**
  this is similar to while loop but has one key difference : it will always run the code inside the curly braces at least once even if the condition evaluates to *false*
