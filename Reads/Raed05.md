# Operators and Loops
## Comparison operators 
- Is equal to (**==**)
this operator compares to values (numbers, strings or boolean) to see if they are the same.
- Is not equal to (**!=**)
  this operator compares to values (numbers, strings or boolean) to see if they are not the same.
- Strict equal to (**===**)
  this operator compares two values (numbers, strings or boolean) to check poth the datatype and value are the same.
- Strict not equal to (**!==**)
  this operator compares two values (numbers, strings or boolean) to check poth the datatype and value are not the same.
- Greater than (**>**)
  this operator checks if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right.
- Less than (**<**)
  this operator checks if the number on the left is less than the number on the right.
- Greater than or equal to (**>=**)
  this operator checks if the number on the left is greater than or equal to the number on the right.
- Less than or equal to (**<=**)
  this operator checks if the number on the left is less than or equal to the number on the right.

## Logical operators
Comparison operatores usually return single values of true and false while logical operatores allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.

- Logical AND (**&&**)
  this operator tests more than one condition (if both expression evaluate to true then the expression returns true. If just one of these return false then the expression returns false).
- logical OR (**||**)
  this operator tests at least one condition (if either expression evaluates to true then the expression returns true. If both return false then the expression returns false).
- Logical NOT (**!**) 
  This operator takes a single boolean value and inverts it  ()
