# Git Tutorial

- Version Control:
  **Version Control** is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Through version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes.

  The need for collaboration within a developer team on a single file or set of files led to the advent of the **Centralized Version Control System** (CVCS). This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients.

- Local Repository Structure:
  The local Git repository has three components:
  1. Working Directory: The actual files reside here.
  2. Index: The area used for staging.
  3. Head: Points to the most recent commit.
