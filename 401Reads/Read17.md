## AWS: S3 and Lambda

1. Describe “The Cloud”
   The cloud refers to software and services that run on the Internet, instead of locally on your computer. It's what allows you to make edits to a file in Google Docs on your home computer, and then pick up where you left off when you get to the office.

2. What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?
   A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

3. What is auto-scaling?
   AWS Auto Scaling lets you build scaling plans that automate how groups of different resources respond to changes in demand. You can optimize availability, costs, or a balance of both. AWS Auto Scaling automatically creates all of the scaling policies and sets targets for you based on your preference.

4. What is bandwidth?
   The maximum amount of data transmitted over an internet connection in a given amount of time. Bandwidth is often mistaken for internet speed when it's actually the volume of information that can be sent over a connection in a measured amount of time – calculated in megabits per second (Mbps).

5. How do cloud providers compute service costs?
   Pricing is usually based on a per-gigabyte monthly rate, along with any applicable charges for network egress and API requests — but it can get more complicated depending on the service and vendor. With some cloud providers, for example, the price per gigabyte decreases as your overall storage usage increases.
