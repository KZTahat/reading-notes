# Get Ready for 401

## Proplem Solving 
When most programmers are given a programming problem in an interview, they make several key mistakes.  The most severe of those is the improper allocation of time.<br />

If you have heard the saying “measure twice and cut once,” then you are probably familiar with the idea of spending upfront time to make sure something is done right, rather than diving right in.<br />

The most common mistake I see when conducting interviews or watching someone try to solve a programming problem is they try to start writing code as soon as possible.<br />

The simple set of steps: <br />

1. **Read the problem completely twice.**
    This is the single most important step.  You may even want to read the problem 3 or 4 times.

    You want to make sure you completely understand the problem.  A good test of this is whether or not you can explain the problem to someone else.

    I cannot over-emphasize how important this step is!

    If you don’t understand the problem, you cannot solve it.  Do not worry about wasting time here, because the better you understand the problem, the easier it will be to solve it.

    If you are given any examples along with the problem, make sure you have worked through the examples and understand why the answers are correct for each one.

2. **Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.**
    Programming is automation plain and simple.  You may have the ability to skip the manual steps and jump directly to code, but there is a manual process which is the foundation of any code you write.

    It is very important to solve the problem manually first, so that you know what you are going to automate, otherwise you are just slinging code around.  Which while can be fun, will make you look like an idiot in a programming interview and will probably cause you to sweat profusely.
    <br />

3. Optimize the manual steps.
    People often don’t realize how valuable this step is.  It is much easier to rearrange and reconstruct and idea or algorithm in your head than it is in code.

    It’s well worth the effort to try and optimize the actual solution or simplify it when it is still in the most easily malleable state.

    What you want to do here is figure out if there is another way you can solve the problem easier, or if there are some steps you can cut our or simplify.
    <br />

4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
    Many times you can skip this step if you have a really good handle on the problem or your previous steps already created a detailed enough description of the solution that coding it is already a 1 to 1 translation.

    If you are a beginner or struggle with these kinds of problems, I would go ahead and take the time to do this step anyway though.

    What we want to do here is capture all the steps we created and now either put them into our editor as comments or write them as psuedo-code that we can translate to real code.

    By doing this, we can know exactly what the structure of the code we are going to write is going to look like which makes the job of filling in the actual code later trivial.
    <br />

5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
    This step should be extremely easy at this point.  If you have done all the other steps, this step involves no problem solving at all.

    All we do here is take each comment and convert it into a real line of code.

    If you struggle here, there are usually two possible reasons:

    1. You didn’t break down the problem into small enough steps.
    2. You don’t know your programming language well enough to do the conversion.

    If you didn’t break the problem down enough, try going back to the second step and being as meticulous as possible.  Write out each and every single step.  I know it is a pain, but do it, believe me it will be worth the effort.
    <br />
6. Optimize the real code.
    Sometimes this step isn’t necessary, but it’s worth taking a look at your code and figuring out if you can cut out a few lines or do something simpler.

    This is also a good place to make sure all your variables are named with long meaningful names.  I cannot stress enough how important having good names for your variables and methods is for helping the person evaluating your code to understand what you were trying to do.  This is especially important when you make a mistake!

## When to Use a 5 Whys Analysis
You can use 5 Whys for troubleshooting, quality improvement, and problem solving, but it is most effective when used to resolve simple or moderately difficult problems.

It may not be suitable if you need to tackle a complex or critical problem. This is because 5 Whys can lead you to pursue a single track, or a limited number of tracks, of inquiry when, in fact, there could be multiple causes. In cases like these, a wider-ranging method such as Cause and Effect Analysis or Failure Mode and Effects Analysis  may be more effective.

- How to Use the 5 Whys: <br />
The model follows a very simple seven-step process:

1. Assemble a Team: <br />
    Gather together people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem, and with the process that you're trying to fix. Include someone to act as a facilitator , who can keep the team focused on identifying effective counter-measures.

2. Define the Problem: <br />
    If you can, observe the problem in action. Discuss it with your team and write a brief, clear problem statement that you all agree on. For example, "Team A isn't meeting its response time targets" or "Software release B resulted in too many rollback failures."

    Then, write your statement on a whiteboard or sticky note, leaving enough space around it to add your answers to the repeated question, "Why?"

3. Ask the First "Why?": <br />
    Ask your team why the problem is occurring. (For example, "Why isn't Team A meeting its response time targets?")

    Asking "Why?" sounds simple, but answering it requires serious thought. Search for answers that are grounded in fact: they must be accounts of things that have actually happened, not guesses at what might have happened.

    This prevents 5 Whys from becoming just a process of deductive reasoning, which can generate a large number of possible causes and, sometimes, create more confusion as you chase down hypothetical problems.

4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times: <br />
    For each of the answers that you generated in Step 3, ask four further "whys" in succession. Each time, frame the question in response to the answer you've just recorded.

5. Know When to Stop: <br />
    You'll know that you've revealed the root cause of the problem when asking "why" produces no more useful responses, and you can go no further. An appropriate counter-measure or process change should then become evident. (As we said earlier, if you're not sure that you've uncovered the real root cause, consider using a more in-depth problem-solving technique like Cause and Effect Analysis , Root Cause Analysis , or FMEA .)

    If you identified more than one reason in Step 3, repeat this process for each of the different branches of your analysis until you reach a root cause for each one.
