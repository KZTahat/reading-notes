## `useState() Hook`

1. How does React differ from vanilla JS/HTML/CSS?
   React breaks down the UI into smaller and reusable components that can move around data amongst each other. This breaking down of the UI is what gives React an edge over Vanilla JS. This is where React comes in with a great feature i.e its own virtual DOM. The virtual DOM is a shortcut to bypass the manual work.

2. What is the primary difference between a function component and a class component?
   A functional component is just a plain JavaScript function that accepts props as an argument and returns a React element. A class component requires you to extend from React. Component and create a render function which returns a React element. There is no render method used in functional components.
