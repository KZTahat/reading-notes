## Event Driven Applications

1. Why is access control important?<br />
    Access controls limit access to information and information processing systems. When implemented effectively, they mitigate the risk of information being accessed without the appropriate authorisation, unlawfully and the risk of a data breach. <br />

2. Describe an application that would need access control.<br />
    
- Some examples of virtual and physical access control systems include:<br />
    - Login credentials (such as usernames and passwords).<br />
    - PINs and one-time passwords (OTPs).<br />
    - Virtual private network (VPN) access to internal networks.<br />
    - Physical access cards, FOBs, tokens, locks, and keys.<br />
    - Security guards with access lists.<br />

3. What is a role used for?<br />
    Consciously defining each person's role, their responsibilities and success criteria within the team can have an instant positive impact. It ensures that: Everyone knows what they're doing. It sounds simple, but when roles are clear, people know what's expected of them, how to behave and what they need to accomplish.<br />

4. Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?<br />
    Unlike Mandatory Access Control (MAC) where access to system resources is controlled by the operating system (under the control of a system administrator), Discretionary Access Control (DAC) allows each user to control access to their own data.<br />
