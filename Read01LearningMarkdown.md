# Mastring markdown

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown.

let us start with some simple tasks:
1. Text:
  It's very easy to make some words **bold** using double stars (**) or double underscores (__) and other words *italic* using single star (*) or a single underscore (_) with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com), we use the '#' to make headers, You can also create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ). You can also use the keyboard shortcut command + k to create a link.
  
2. Lists: Lists can be made easily by numbers (1., 2., 3.) or simple dashes (-) and if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star.

3. Images:If you want to embed images, this is how you do it: "![Image discreption](Image URL)"
