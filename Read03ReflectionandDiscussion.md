# Reflection and Discussion
## HTML5 Layout
***HTML5*** introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors using them already, and this set of elements include:

- the header which contains the title and navigation bar.
- the main which includes articles, sections and asides.
- and the footer part where some info such copyright           information takes place.

## the <header> and <footer>
elements can be used for:
● The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.
● A header or footer for an individual <article> or <section> within the page.

## navigation bar
the <nav> element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.

## articles
The <article> element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated, This could be an individual article or blog entry, a comment or forum post, or any other independent piece of content.

## asides
he <aside> element has two purposes, depending on whether it is inside an <article> element or not.

## sections 
The <section> element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.
